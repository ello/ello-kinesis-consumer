This is a deployable app that consumes domain events from Kinesis to syndicate
data out to several third-party integrations.

Currently, it integrates with Mailchimp (for newsletter management) and
Knowtify (for drip campaigns).

## Setup

This project uses [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to
manage application configuration in development.  To get started, you
need to `cp .env.example .env` to setup the local development
environment variables.

You'll also need a working Ruby 2.3 setup with bundler

Once those are set up, you can run the tests with `rake`.
